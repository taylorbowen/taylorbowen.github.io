	<h1>Has Design become too hard?</h1>
	<h2><a 	href="http://www.zeldman.com/2016/06/05/transcription-design-become-hard/">Article</a> by Jeffery Zeldman</h2>

<p>
 <b>"Designers love to complain. It’s our nature. After all, if we were satisfied with the way things work, feel, and look, we wouldn’t have become designers in the first place."</b> </p>

<p>
 <ins>In this article</ins>, Jefferey Zeldman is asking the question, "Is design hard?" Although I am new to the design world I am going to have to say yes. Not just because this is something new to me, but because there are a vast majority of rules and things that one must learn. Not only learning the rules, but being able to not follow them and still have a solid piece of work. Being able to use the rules and break them.
